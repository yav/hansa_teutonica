Note on Retreating
==================

There is some ambiguity in the rules with exactly what happens when an
attacker looses a battle.  The rules state that they must "retreat" to
the city they came from, however, it is not clear if full retreat rules
apply, or if it simply means the attacker just goes back to where they were.

This question is asked on BGG but is unanswered, and in many related
question the designer seems to only consider "retreating" in the context
of defending armies loosing, so I choose to interpret this as meaning
"go back to the city".  I think this also makes Arab sea attacks more
viable, as otherwise they'd be extremely risky if someone else controls
the Byznatene army---lossing the battle would destroy your whole army
which seems no fun.

XXX: actually just doing a standard retreat might not be all that bad:
if any army is defeated, then it likely has very few members anyway,
so perhaps it's not terrible if it just gets destroyed.

Note on the Byzantine Fleet
===========================

If an activation of the Byzantine fleet makes is so that the player
cannot afford the move then they can pick a different route and there is
no attack on the Arab army.  If there isn't another option, then their action
ends.  See: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/108294/byzantine-fleet
